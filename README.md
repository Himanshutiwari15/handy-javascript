## What is JavaScript ?
- JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.
- JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.
- JavaScript is easy to learn.

## What is REPO for ?
I will be showing you the journey, How I learned [`JAVASCRIPT`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) :firecracker:

## Different Functions for Arrays in javascript

**Method** | **Discription**
------------ | -------------
concat()	| Joins two or more arrays, and returns a copy of the joined arrays
copyWithin() |	Copies array elements within the array, to and from specified positions
entries()	| Returns a key/value pair Array Iteration Object
every() |	Checks if every element in an array pass a test
fill()	| Fill the elements in an array with a static value
filter()	| Creates a new array with every element in an array that pass a test
find()	| Returns the value of the first element in an array that pass a test
findIndex()| Returns the index of the first element in an array that pass a test
forEach()	| Calls a function for each array element
from() | Creates an array from an object
includes()	| Check if an array contains the specified element
indexOf()	| Search the array for an element and returns its position
isArray()	| Checks whether an object is an array
join()	| Joins all elements of an array into a string
keys()	| Returns a Array Iteration Object, containing the keys of the original array
lastIndexOf() |	Search the array for an element, starting at the end, and returns its position
map()	| Creates a new array with the result of calling a function for each array element
pop()	| Removes the last element of an array, and returns that element
push()	| Adds new elements to the end of an array, and returns the new length
reduce()	| Reduce the values of an array to a single value (going left-to-right)
reduceRight() |	Reduce the values of an array to a single value (going right-to-left)
reverse()	| Reverses the order of the elements in an array
shift()	| Removes the first element of an array, and returns that element
slice()	| Selects a part of an array, and returns the new array
some()	| Checks if any of the elements in an array pass a test
sort()	| Sorts the elements of an array
splice()	| Adds/Removes elements from an array
toString()	| Converts an array to a string, and returns the result
unshift()	| Adds new elements to the beginning of an array, and returns the new length
valueOf()	| Returns the primitive value of an array

## Accessing Properties on an Object
There are two ways to access properties on an object:
- Dot Notation
- Bracket Notation

#### Dot Notation

````javascript
let obj = {
  cat: 'meow',
  dog: 'woof'
};
let sound = obj.cat;
console.log(sound);
// meow
````

#### Bracket Notation

````javascript
let obj = {
  cat: 'meow',
  dog: 'woof'
};
let sound = obj['cat'];
console.log(sound);
// meow
````

### Conclusion

> Use the Dot Notation. But if you’re dealing with invalid identifier or variables, use the Bracket notation.

## Closures in Javascript
> A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.
